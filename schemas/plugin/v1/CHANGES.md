# Changes to the plugin records, version 1

Each schema carries its own version in `x-version`. While a schema is `1.0-draft.N`, any change bumps
`N` and is listed here with what it breaks. A schema becomes `1.0` when every consumer lane named for
it in `README.md` has a passing fixture in `fixtures/`.

## `install.v1.json` is `1.0-draft.2` (Nov 13, 2026)

A grant lists only the seven permissions today's reader takes. Draft 1 let a grant list the five names
that are new in the version 1 manifest (`surface`, `command`, `subscribe`, `tool`, `run`), and today's
reader refuses such a file (`daemon/plugins.py`, `read_install`), so the schema's own claim, that a
file written to it is read by today's daemon, was false. What it breaks: an install file that grants
one of the five. Granting them needs the reader to change first; this schema will say so when it does.

## Fixtures that prove every rule (Nov 13, 2026)

No schema changed. Each `additionalProperties: false`, each name in a `required` list, each `enum` and
each `const` is now taken away, one at a time, and a bad fixture must notice (see
`conformance/README.md`). In this folder: 17 closed objects (17 proved before), 54 required fields (6
before), 6 lists of allowed values (3 before) and 8 fixed values (4 before); all 85 are proved now, by
68 generated fixtures (`u-*`, `m-*`, `v-*`, `f-*`: a good fixture with one change) and one more good
fixture written by hand (a run in a worktree).

## 1.0-draft.1 (Nov 13, 2026)

First drafts. Nothing is frozen.

| Schema | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest.v1.json` | 1.0-draft.1 | The ten present fields, plus `runtime`, `interface`, `files`; five provisional permission names appended |
| `install.v1.json` | 1.0-draft.1 | Today's `install.json`, with nothing added |
| `api.v1.json` | 1.0-draft.1 | A skeleton of the entry points as data, and five rules that hold whatever the shapes become |
| `revoked-keys.v1.json` | 1.0-draft.1 | The minimum: a rising list version, issue and expiry times, the revoked keys, the list key's signature |

### Provisional choices in this draft

Built as recommended and **not decided**:

| Choice | Built as | Alternative | Whose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Freeze the plugin contract as version 1 | Now, as a draft until consumers' fixtures pass | After launch | The owner's |
| New permission names and their order | `surface`, `command`, `subscribe`, `tool`, `run`, appended after `order` | Other names, or none | The owner's |
